# My .emacs setup

## Main tenets

* Prefer basic semantic highlighting via grayscale & font weight; **no** syntax highlighting
* I use `evil`, but my bindings are a chaotic mix of both vim & emacs philosophies
* Favour LSP to power an IDE-like experience wherever possible (I use `lsp-mode`)
* `org-mode` for building out a second brain (via `org-roam`), task management (via a GTD-esque workflow within `org-roam`), and literate development (via `org-babel`)
* `straight.el` for package management
