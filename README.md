# My Emacs config

## Installation

Coming soon. It *should* work out of the box.

## Packages of note

Most of my work is on the frontend, which is reflected in my setup. Some packages of note:

- Evil
- Ivy
- Spacemacs leader keys 
- Projectile
- Flycheck
- Web mode with support for Flow, Stylelint, and Prettier
