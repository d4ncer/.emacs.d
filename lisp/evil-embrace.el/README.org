Evil integration of [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/embrace.el][embrace.el]].

* Overview
This package provides evil integration of [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/embrace.el][embrace.el]]. Since =evil-surround=
provides a similar set of features as =embrace.el=, this package aims at adding
the goodies of =embrace.el= to =evil-surround= and making =evil-surround= even
better.

* Why
=evil-surround= is good when there is a text object defined. But unfortunately,
if you want to add custom surrouding pairs, =evil-surround= will not be able to
delete/change the pairs if there are no evil text objects defined for these
pairs. For example, if you want to make =\textbf{= and =}= as a surround pair in
=LaTeX-mode=, you can't either change or delete the surround pair since there is
no text object for =\textbf{= and =}=. However, using =embrace=, you can define
whatever surrounding pairs you like, and adding, changing, and deleting will
*always* work.

The idea of this package is that let =evil-surround= handle the keys that
corresponds to existing text objects (i.e., =(=, =[=, etc.), which is what
=evil-surround= is good at, and make =embrace= handles all the other keys of
custom surrounding pairs so that you can also benefit from the extensibility
that =embrace= offers.

In a word, you can use the default =evil-surround=. But whenever you want to add
a custom surrounding pair, use =embrace= instead. To see how to add a custom
pair in =embrace=, look at the README of [[https://github.com/cute-jumper/embrace.el][embrace.el]].

* Usage
  To enable the =evil-surround= integration:
  : (evil-embrace-enable-evil-surround-integration)

  And use =evil-embrace-disable-evil-surround-integration= to disable whenever
  you don't like it.

  The keys that are processed by =evil-surround= are saved in the variable
  =evil-embrace-evil-surround-keys=. The default value is:
  : (?\( ?\[ ?\{ ?\) ?\] ?\} ?\" ?\' ?< ?> ?b ?B ?t)

  Note that this variable is buffer-local. You should change it in the hook:
  : (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook
  :     (lambda ()
  :        (add-to-list 'evil-embrace-evil-surround-keys ?o)))

  Only these keys saved in the variable are processed by =evil-surround=, and
  all the other keys will be processed by =embrace=.

  If you find the help message popup annoying, use the following code to disable it:
  : (setq evil-embrace-show-help-p nil)

* Screencasts
  Use the following settings:
  : (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'embrace-org-mode-hook)
  : (evil-embrace-enable-evil-surround-integration)

  In an org-mode file, we can change the surrounding pair in the following way
  (note that this whole process can't be achieved solely by =evil-surround=):
