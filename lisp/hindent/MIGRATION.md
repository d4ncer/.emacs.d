hindent will now only support one style, based on the Johan Tibell
style.

* The API will move away from supporting different styles.
* The command-line interface will remove the `--style` flag, ignoring
  it silently.
* Issues related to different styles will be closed.
* The test suite will be restricted to the one style.
