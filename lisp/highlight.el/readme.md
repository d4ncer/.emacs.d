# highlight.el

This repo mirrors `highlight.el` by Drew Adams from the [EmacsWiki](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/highlight.el).

Since [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) is not accepting EmacsWiki as package source anymore, the repo enables packages on MELPA to keep relying on `highlight.el`.

Please send bug reports, questions etc. directly to Drew Adams as he continues to develop this library.

Thanks!
