;; Add hook helper macros from Doom

;;; Code:

(defun doom-unquote (exp)
  "Return EXP unquoted."
  (while (memq (car-safe exp) '(quote function))
    (setq exp (cadr exp)))
  exp)

(defun doom-enlist (exp)
  "Return EXP wrapped in a list, or as-is if already a list."
  (if (listp exp) exp (list exp)))

(defun doom--resolve-hook-forms (hooks)
  (cl-loop with quoted-p = (eq (car-safe hooks) 'quote)
           for hook in (doom-enlist (doom-unquote hooks))
           if (eq (car-safe hook) 'quote)
           collect (cadr hook)
           else if quoted-p
           collect hook
           else collect (intern (format "%s-hook" (symbol-name hook)))))

(defmacro add-hook! (&rest args)
  "A convenience macro for `add-hook'. Takes, in order:
  1. Optional properties :local and/or :append, which will make the hook
     buffer-local or append to the list of hooks (respectively),
  2. The hooks: either an unquoted major mode, an unquoted list of major-modes,
     a quoted hook variable or a quoted list of hook variables. If unquoted, the
     hooks will be resolved by appending -hook to each symbol.
  3. A function, list of functions, or body forms to be wrapped in a lambda.
Examples:
    (add-hook! 'some-mode-hook 'enable-something)
    (add-hook! some-mode '(enable-something and-another))
    (add-hook! '(one-mode-hook second-mode-hook) 'enable-something)
    (add-hook! (one-mode second-mode) 'enable-something)
    (add-hook! :append (one-mode second-mode) 'enable-something)
    (add-hook! :local (one-mode second-mode) 'enable-something)
    (add-hook! (one-mode second-mode) (setq v 5) (setq a 2))
    (add-hook! :append :local (one-mode second-mode) (setq v 5) (setq a 2))
Body forms can access the hook's arguments through the let-bound variable
`args'."

  (let ((hook-fn 'add-hook)
        append-p local-p)

        (:local  (setq local-p t))

           (let ((val (car args)))
             (if (memq (car-safe val) '(quote function))
                 (if (cdr-safe (cadr val))
                     (cadr val)
                   (list (cadr val)))
               (list args))))

                forms)))
