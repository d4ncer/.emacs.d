;;; +load-incrementally.el --- Extra keywords for use-package -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Extend use-package to support incremental loading of deferred packages. This
;; makes it more likely that Emacs will have already loaded a feature in the
;; background by the time you attempt to use it in your session.
;;
;; The two added keywords are `:defer-incrementally' and `:after-call'.
;;
;; This functionality is taken from Doom; see the use-package module.
;;
;; :after-call SYMBOL|LIST
;;   Takes a symbol or list of symbols representing functions or hook variables.
;;   The first time any of these functions or hooks are executed, the package is
;;   loaded.
;;
;; :defer-incrementally SYMBOL|LIST|t
;;   Takes a symbol or list of symbols representing packages that will be loaded
;;   incrementally at startup before this one. This is helpful for large packages
;;   like magit or org, which load a lot of dependencies on first load. This lets
;;   you load them piece-meal during idle periods, so that when you finally do need
;;   the package, it'll load quicker.
;;
;;   NAME is implicitly added if this property is present and non-nil. No need to
;;   specify it. A value of `t' implies NAME.
