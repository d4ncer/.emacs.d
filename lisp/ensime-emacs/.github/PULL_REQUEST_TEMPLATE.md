Thank you for contributing to ENSIME!

If this is your first time submitting a PR, this is what you can expect:

1. You'll have to agree to the licences we use. You'll get a link to follow in a moment.
2. Your code will be automatically tested. That can take as long as an hour before the results come back. You can read `.drone.yml` to see what is being run.
3. We'll try to review your code and give feedback quickly.
4. Please squash your commits into independent units. We use the commit log as our changelog so it is good if your commit messages are clear and concise.
5. You can request an ENSIME sticker from `@fommil`, be sure to ask if you want one!
6. If everything goes silent, please ping us.

Now, delete this line and everything above it, then tell us which tickets this PR closes (please don't reference tickets directly from your commit messages).
