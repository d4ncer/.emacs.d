;;; Commentary:

;; Extract the JIRA ticket number from the current branch name, and prepend
;; commit messages with that ticket number.

;; Add `(git-commit-jira-prefix-init)' to your Emacs configuration to initialise the package. If you
;; use `use-package', the form below will do the right thing:
;;
;;   (use-package git-commit-jira-prefix
;;     :after git-commit
;;     :commands git-commit-jira-prefix-init
;;     :config (git-commit-jira-prefix-init))
