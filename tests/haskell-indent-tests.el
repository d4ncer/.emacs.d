SOURCE should be a string representing Haskell source code.  It
will be inserted in a brand-new buffer where `haskell-mode' and
`haskell-indent-mode' are enabled.  Position of point and
expected results of `haskell-indentation-find-indentations' are
described in TEST-CASES.

Every element in TEST-CASES list should have the following
structure:

    (line pos0 pos1 pos2 …)

point will be placed in the first column of LINE before testing.
POS0, POS1, POS2, … are expressions representing indentation
positions.

For example:

    (2 0 7)

means that when point is placed at line 2 and column 0,
`haskell-indentation-find-indentations' should return value that's
equal to (0 7).

It's recommended to specify several test-cases per one snippet
because it helps increase coverage."
